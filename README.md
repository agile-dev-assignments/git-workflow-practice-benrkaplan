##Why this article:

As software developers I personally believe that it is important to acknowledge not only the code we write but who it's for / the purpose it serves. Technology is supposed to enable new abilities and enhance productivity more than the past. Seeing software written exclusively to lock people out of repair things they own feels like too much corporate greed. Seeing that there is a black market for these farmers to get workarounds and "hack" their John Deeres is definitely a positive step but thinking about right to repair issues and who we are using our knowledge for is important. The ramifications of code aren't just what it does directly, it can affect people and this shows that.
