## Why this article:

As software developers I personally believe that it is important to acknowledge not only the code we write but who it's for / the purpose it serves. Technology is supposed to enable new abilities and enhance productivity more than the past. Seeing software written exclusively to lock people out of repair things they own feels like too much corporate greed. Seeing that there is a black market for these farmers to get workarounds and "hack" their John Deeres is definitely a positive step but thinking about right to repair issues and who we are using our knowledge for is important. The ramifications of code aren't just what it does directly, it can affect people and this shows that.

## Lev's comment

The right to repair is an essential one, a right that is often overlooked due to its lack of formal protection in the Constitution.
I was first alerted to the issue around half a year ago, when I watched [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8JCh0owT4w)
The general ethos of "you should understand how your technology works" is excellent, though difficult to follow given the complexity of modern technology.
Courses like CSO help with that, but a program on a much larger scale will be required in order for that kind of technological literacy to become widespread.
